This project focuses on the simulation and prediction of wind speed at a meteorological station in Hong Kong (Station ID: 45032). 
The two namelist.* files contain the configuration settings for the mesoscale WRF model. Additionally, the four .py scripts are used to extract boundary condition data from the WRF output and export it in .txt format.
